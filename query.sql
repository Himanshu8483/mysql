DBMS (Database Management System)

• Software for storing, retrieving, managing, and manipulating data.

• Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

Data vs Information

• Data: Raw facts (e.g., numbers, names).

• Information: Processed data with meaning (e.g., sales reports).

DBMS Models

1. Relational Model: Data in tables (SQL-based). (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

2. Network Model: Data as nodes & connections. (e.g., IDS)

3. Hierarchical Model: Data in tree structure. (e.g., IMS)

4. Object-Oriented Model: Data as objects. (e.g., ObjectStore)

5. Document-Oriented Model: Data in documents (JSON/XML). (e.g., MongoDB)

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

• Based on the relational model, uses SQL.

• Examples:

o Oracle (Enterprise-level)

o SQL Server (Microsoft's database)

o MySQL (Open-source, web apps)

o PostgreSQL (Advanced open-source)

o MariaDB (Fork of MySQL)

SQL (Structured Query Language)

• Used to interact with relational databases.

• Operations:

o Create → INSERT (Add data)

o Read → SELECT (Retrieve data)

o Update → UPDATE (Modify data)

o Delete → DELETE (Remove data)

• Also manages tables, views, indexes, and security.
